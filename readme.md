### **Objective:**

> To demonstrate knowledge of Web APIs, asynchronous functions and fetch requests to populate a page dynamically.

> This webpage utilizes one of NASA's open APIs: [NASA Image and Video Library](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf). The user arrives at a full screen landing page. Upon searching, the website makes a fetch call using the NASA open API. Results are displayed as cards, using Bootstrap 4's built-in masonry effect. Animations and functionality are performed using jQuery and JavaScript, respectively.
